# AI Voice Assistant

This project is an AI-generated voice assistant, inspired by popular voice assistants like Siri and Alexa. Utilizing the powerful APIs from [play.ht](https://play.ht/) for voice generation and [OpenAI](https://www.openai.com/) for natural language processing, this assistant aims to provide an interactive and intuitive experience for users.

## Features

- **Voice Generation**: Leverages the play.ht API to generate lifelike human voices in response to user queries.
- **Advanced NLP**: Uses OpenAI's state-of-the-art models to understand and process user inputs, ensuring relevant responses.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed.
- API keys for play.ht and OpenAI.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MarBakerswe/Lets_Talk.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd Lets_Talk
    npm install
    ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys:
    ```
    PLAYHT_API_KEY=your_playht_api_key
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
    ```

4. Start the application:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

The application should now be running locally, and you can interact with the voice assistant.
